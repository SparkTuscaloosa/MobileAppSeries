# Mobile App Series

This is the repo for a series of talks from Spark Tuscaloosa.

In this series we'll introduce you to some basic skills needed to build your first app. We will show you how to create your app's front-end using [Ionic Creator](https://creator.ionic.io/). In the second part of the series we will show you how to create a basic backend using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). In the final part of the series we will hook the front-end and backend up.

## Resources

We will be using [Ionic Creator](https://creator.ionic.io/) to build the front-end and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to build the backend. The app we are building utilizes [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/) to allow the front-end and backend to communicate.


## Part 1

Part one of the series requires you to have an Ionic Creator account. You can signup for an account, [here](https://creator.ionic.io/).

## Part 2

If you would like to participate in part 2 of this series you need to do a little work beforehand. 

First, you need to make sure Node is installed on your computer. If you do not have Node installed you can find instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Next, you will need to install Prisma via NPM. NPM is Node's package/library management system. NPM is installed with Node. To install Prisma via NPM run the following command in a terminal window.

```
npm install -g prisma 
```

**Development Database**

If you already have a local MySQL or PostgreSQL database running on your computer, you are good to go. If you do not, we suggest installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on to your computer. You can find [Mac install](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) or [Windows install](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) instructions [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
