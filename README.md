# Mobile App Series

This is the repo for a series of talks from Spark Tuscaloosa.


## Resources

We will be using [Ionic Creator](https://creator.ionic.io/) to build the front-end and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to build the backend. The app we are building utilizes [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/) to allow the front-end and backend to communicate.
