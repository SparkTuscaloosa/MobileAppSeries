# Mobile App Series

This is the repo for a series of talks from Spark Tuscaloosa.


In this series we'll introduce you to some basic skills needed to build your first app. We will show you how to create your app's front-end using [Ionic Creator](https://creator.ionic.io/). In the second part of the series we will show you how to create a basic backend using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). In the final part of the series we will hook the front-end and backend up.

## Resources

We will be using [Ionic Creator](https://creator.ionic.io/) to build the front-end and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to build the backend. The app we are building utilizes [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/) to allow the front-end and backend to communicate.


Before the start of each talk you will need to make sure you have the following installed or access to.
